üìö Library Management System API
This project implements a RESTful API for a Library Management System, built with Express, TypeScript, and MongoDB (via Mongoose). It provides functionalities for managing books and handling borrowing records, incorporating robust data validation, business logic, and advanced database operations like aggregation.

üéØ Objective
The primary objective is to develop a backend API for a Library Management System, focusing on:

Efficient management of book inventory.

Tracking of borrowed books.

Enforcement of business rules (e.g., book availability).

Use of modern web development practices with TypeScript.

Demonstration of Mongoose features like schema validation, static/instance methods, and middleware.

Leveraging MongoDB's aggregation pipeline for reporting.

‚ú® Features
Book Management:

Create, retrieve (all, by ID), update, and delete books.

Filtering and sorting capabilities for book listings.

Borrowing System:

Record book borrowing transactions.

Business logic to ensure book availability before borrowing.

Automatic update of book availability status based on copies count.

Data Validation: Strict schema validation for all incoming data using Mongoose.

Business Logic Enforcement: Examples include available status updates and quantity checks during borrowing.

Mongoose Advanced Features:

Schema Validation: Defined directly in models (required, enum, min, unique).

Middleware (Pre-Save Hook): Automatically updates book available status before saving based on copies.

Instance Method: checkAndUpdateAvailability on the Book model to programmatically update availability.

Aggregation Pipeline: A dedicated endpoint to summarize borrowed books, demonstrating MongoDB's powerful aggregation framework.

Error Handling: Centralized global error handling for consistent and informative error responses (validation errors, duplicate keys, 404s, etc.).

üöÄ Technology Stack
Backend Framework: Express.js

Language: TypeScript

Database: MongoDB

ODM (Object Data Modeling): Mongoose

Environment Variables: Dotenv

üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine:

1. Clone the Repository
git clone <your-repository-link>
cd <your-project-directory>

2. Install Dependencies
Install all required Node.js packages:

npm install

3. Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root of your project directory and add the following environment variables:

MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/libraryDB
PORT=3000

Replace mongodb://localhost:27017/libraryDB with your actual MongoDB connection string. If you're using MongoDB Atlas, copy your connection string from there.

You can change the PORT to your desired port number.

4. Run the Application
Development Mode (with hot-reloading)
npm run dev

The server will start on the specified port (default: http://localhost:3000). ts-node-dev will automatically restart the server on code changes.

Production Build & Start
First, build the TypeScript project:

npm run build

Then, start the compiled JavaScript application:

npm start

```
üåê Deployment
This application is configured for easy deployment on Vercel.

Steps for Vercel Deployment:
vercel.json: Ensure you have a vercel.json file in your project root configured as described in the deployment instructions provided previously.

Environment Variables: Set your MONGO_URI as an environment variable in your Vercel project settings (Dashboard -> Project -> Settings -> Environment Variables).

Git Integration: Connect your GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket repository to Vercel. Vercel will automatically detect your project setup and deploy it upon pushes to the configured branch.

Vercel CLI: Alternatively, use the Vercel CLI (vercel deploy) from your project root.

‚úÖ Code Quality & Best Practices
Clean and Readable Code: Emphasizes meaningful variable/function names and clear logic.

Modular Structure: Separation of concerns (models, controllers, routes, middleware, utils) for maintainability.

Asynchronous Error Handling: catchAsync utility centralizes error catching for async route handlers.

Consistent API Responses: apiResponse utility ensures uniform success and error payloads.

TypeScript: Strong typing throughout the application for improved code quality and reduced runtime errors.
